# Person API

The Person API is a simple Flask-based RESTful web service that allows you to manage a list of persons, storing their names and ages in an SQLite database. This API provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting person records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Person API locally, you need the following software installed:

- Python
- Flask
- SQLite

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/person-api.git
   cd person-api
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create an SQLite database:

   ```bash
   touch persons.db
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

By default, the API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage Examples

You can use tools like `curl`, `httpie`, or create a client application to interact with the API. Examples of API usage can be found in the [UsageExamples.md](UsageExamples.md) file.

## Deployment

To deploy this API in a production environment, consider using a production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI) and a more robust database system instead of SQLite.
